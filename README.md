# Re:public 

Re:public - is a CI/CD automation platform designed specifically for smart contract development. Deploy contracts with single click on multiple chains. It's just like Vercel but for web3.

The latest deployment can be found here: https://re-public.vercel.app/

This is an [Eth London Hackathon 2024](https://ethglobal.com/events/london2024) submission, the project was build in just 2 days.

## Overview

The primary objective of Re:public is to accelerate the time-to-market and lower the entry barrier for Web3 development. Developers no longer need to engage in manual deployments or handle individual deployments for each testnet chain. Our platform automates this process, enabling developers to specify which branches should be deployed to their desired chains.

For instance, a push to the "test-arbitrum" branch can trigger an automatic deployment on Arbitrum, while a push to the "general-test" branch could simultaneously deploy to three chains: Arbitrum, Near, and Polygon Testnets.

Another noteworthy feature is that users are not required to have a deep understanding of Web3 concepts like "gas" or "wallets." Re:public brings a Web2 cloud experience to Web3, where each push to a Git repository initiates an automatic deployment to various environments, including production, staging, and development. This seamless integration streamlines the development process, making it more accessible and efficient for developers venturing into the world of Web3.
